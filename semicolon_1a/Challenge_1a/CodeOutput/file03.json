TAL’s business planning took several years. TAL’s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries.
