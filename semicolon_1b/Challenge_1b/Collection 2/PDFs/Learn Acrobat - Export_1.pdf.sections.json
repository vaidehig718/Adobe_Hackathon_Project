Select the \nsettings icon to change the export \npreferences.  \nTIFF is a flexible bitmap image format supported by virtually all paint, image-editing, and \npage-layout applications. Resolution is determined automatically. \n \nFile settings \nMonochrome \nSpecifies a compression format. CCITTG4 is the default and generally produces the smallest \nfile size. ZIP compression also produces a small file. \nNote:  \nSome applications cannot open TIFF files that are saved with JPEG or ZIP compression. In \nthese cases, LZW compression is recommended.   \n \nColor management \nRGB/CMYK/Grayscale/Other \nSpecifies the type of color management for the output file. \n \nConversion \nColorspace/Resolution \nSpecifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these \nsettings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale. \nNote:  \nHigher resolutions, such as 2400 ppi, are suitable only for small page sizes (up to 6.826 inches \nor 173.380 millimeters)."
