    "section_text": "Edit Scanned PDFs \nEditing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non-\neditable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility \nissues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from \nscanned images. \nTo streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing \na scanned document: \nCheck the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a \nscanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the \ndocument editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is \naccurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize \nText tool to improve the output. \nEnhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance \nscanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before \nattempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. \nUse the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and \nformatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't \nhave the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. \nRemove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, \nremove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove \nsecurity from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF. \nAvoid editing complex elements. If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, \navoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. \nCheck for compatibility issues.
