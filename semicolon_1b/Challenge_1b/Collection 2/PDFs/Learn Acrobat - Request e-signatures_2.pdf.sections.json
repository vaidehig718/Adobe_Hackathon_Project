The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server \naccess to use them. \nALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document \nrecipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients \nfrom LDAP directories. \nUse ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, \nediting, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. \n \nWhat is a digital signature? \nDigital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate \ndocuments, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign \ndocuments quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. \n \nWhy validate a digital signature? \nWhen you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the \nsigner and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, \nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the \nauthenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. \nTo verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are \ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader settings. \nTo verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after \nsigning. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes."

The form author provides XML signing, validating, or \nclearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. \nXML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital \nsignatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in \ndocuments. \nHowever, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a \nuser alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification \nstates, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. \n \nEstablish long-term signature validation \nLong-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the \ndocument was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation \nmust be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the \ndocument signing process or added afterward. \nIf certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a \nlimited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. \nWhen a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing \nrevocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. \nThe necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate \nrevocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, \nthe signature can be validated without requiring external resources. \nAcrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF \ncreator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger \nmenu   (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader \nextended PDF. \nNote: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp \nserver. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating \nto Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab. \nCDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the \ndocument without requiring any configuration from the signer.
